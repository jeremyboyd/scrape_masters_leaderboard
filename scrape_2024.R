# Description: Scrape Masters leaderboard data every 60 seconds and write to a
# Google sheet.

# This package could provide a solution that uses chromote to read live pages
# and also allows for interactivity:

# Packages
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(googlesheets4)

# once when the script is first run.
